<p>FORCsensei has been built using Dask-based parallism (https://dask.org). This means you can use it on your laptop, but it will also readily scale up for use on clusters with a minimum of fuss. If you would like to run FORCsensei on your own HPC facility, please ask your HPC system administrator to contact us for advice. </p>
