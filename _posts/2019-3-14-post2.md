 <h2> FORCsensei Mobile </h2>
 <p>If you use the cloud-based version of FORCsensei, then you can process FORC data while you are on the go. Install Dropbox on your phone or tablet and use your device to launch a instance of <a href="https://forcaist.github.io/FORCaist.github.io/amybinder.html" target="_blank">FORCsensei on the cloud</a>. FORCsensei will link with Dropbox so you can upload data and download results. Calculation takes place on the cloud, so you can still play Fruit Ninja while processing data!</p>
