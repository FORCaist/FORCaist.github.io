 <h2> FORCsensei Mobile </h2>
 <p>If you use the cloud-based version of FORCsensei, then you can process FORC data while you are on the go. Install Dropbox on your phone or tablet and use your device to launch a instance of FORCsensei on the cloud. FORCsensei will link with Dropbox so you can upload data and download results. Calculation takes place on the cloud, so you can still play Fruit Ninja while processing data!</p>
 <p>Launch FORCsensei on the cloud using this button:</p>
